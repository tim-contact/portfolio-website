This project implements an **optimal Tic-Tac-Toe AI** using the Minimax algorithm.  
The agent evaluates all possible game states recursively and always chooses the optimal move, making it impossible to defeat.

Built as part of the CS50 AI course, this project strengthened my understanding of adversarial search and game theory.
