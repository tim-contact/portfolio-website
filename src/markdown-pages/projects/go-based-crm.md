This project is a full-stack **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** system built for an overseas-study consultancy to streamline student lead tracking and communication.  
The backend is fully implemented in **Go (Gin + GORM)** with **PostgreSQL**, **Redis caching**, and a **modular containerized architecture** using Docker Compose.

The system provides secure authentication, real-time API-driven operations, and a clear foundation for scaling into a complete analytics and workflow tool.

This project was built to strengthen my backend engineering skills, deepen my understanding of Go, and gain experience building production-ready API architectures.
