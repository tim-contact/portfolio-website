This project is a **knowledge-based AI agent** that plays Minesweeper autonomously using propositional logic.  
It maintains logical sentences about mine probabilities, performs subset reasoning, and makes strategic decisions with incomplete information.

Developed as part of the Harvard CS50 AI course, it was a major milestone in understanding how logic-based AI systems operate.
