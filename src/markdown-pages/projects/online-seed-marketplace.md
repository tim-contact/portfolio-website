This project is a full-stack online marketplace where users can buy and sell cultivated seeds.  
Built as a responsive desktop web app, it combines a modern **Next.js front-end** with a fully custom backend API layer.

I took responsibility for all backend operations, including authentication, API design, and database architecture.
