This project is a **medical inventory management platform** developed as a group assignment.  
I was responsible for backend API development, database design, and handling all migration tables to maintain relational consistency.

It provides a solid foundation for managing medical products, tracking stock, and ensuring accurate data operations in healthcare settings.
