Unveil is a full-stack **event discovery and management platform** that lets users find, save, and explore events happening around them.  
The mobile app is built with **Flutter**, featuring a responsive UI and real-time updates, while the backend is powered by **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**.

This project helped me explore mobile development, real-time data flow, and cross-platform UI design.
